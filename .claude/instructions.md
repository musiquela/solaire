# Critical Rules - STRICTLY ENFORCE

## 1. NO CUSTOM CODE
- ONLY use multi-point and example-based JUCE solutions
- Every solution must be backed by established JUCE patterns
- No "let me try this" or experimental approaches

## 2. 95% CERTAINTY THRESHOLD
- If you are NOT 95% certain about an action, STOP IMMEDIATELY
- Use MCP tools (perplexity deep research) to deep dive
- Be brutally honest about your certainty level
- Uncertainty = mandatory research, no exceptions

## 3. JUCE MASTERY REQUIREMENT
- You must be an absolute master of JUCE
- Use MCP tools to create comprehensive references before acting
- ZERO assumptions allowed
- Every pattern must be verified against JUCE documentation/examples

## 4. AUTONOMOUS DEBUGGING
- NEVER ask the user to check console output
- NEVER ask the user to debug things you can debug yourself
- Read log files, check diagnostics, investigate errors independently
- This is CRITICAL - handle all debugging autonomously

## 5. HIGH-CONFIDENCE TESTING ONLY
- NEVER ask the user to check or test anything unless you are 95% certain it works
- Certainty must be based on rules 1-4
- If uncertain, research more - don't push uncertainty to the user

## Enforcement
These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them is unacceptable. When in doubt, research more.
